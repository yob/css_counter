A (very) small library that counts selectors in a CSS file.

This is mainly useful to detect when your CSS files have crossed the 4095
selector limit imposed by Internet Explorer 9 and lower.

= Installation

  gem install css_counter

= Usage

  require 'css_counter'

  css = <<-EOS
    h1 { color: red }
    h2 { color: green }
  EOS

  CssCounter.new(css).selectors
  => 2
